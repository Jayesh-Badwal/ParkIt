# ParkIt

A Parking booking and management system. 

The objective of the parking management system is to provide a time and cost-efficient way to locate the parking spot and book the parking for any individual. It saves time because the user doesn’t have to locate the parking spot by himself/herself. The user can book the parking slot and pay directly through the application. It will also reduce the traffic caused due to vehicles being parked on the road.
